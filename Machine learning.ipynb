    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A chatbot that can engage in conversation, answer questions, and perform tasks like scheduling appointments or ordering food demonstrates AI. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to user queries.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters use machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns from examples of emails that have been marked as spam or not spam by users and uses this knowledge to classify new incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain, learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning enables the model to learn representations of data through multiple layers of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition systems that can identify objects, people, places, and activities in images use deep learning. These systems are trained on a large dataset of labeled images and learn to recognize patterns and features at different levels of abstraction.\n",
